Multi-Agent System for Traffic Coordination: Assignment Report
1. Introduction
This assignment implements a multi-agent system to coordinate traffic flow through a bottleneck point in a lecture hall complex. The system uses the AutoGen framework to create autonomous agents representing classrooms that negotiate with each other to prevent congestion when classes end simultaneously.
The main challenge is that when multiple lectures conclude at the same time, all students converge on the same narrow exit route, creating significant delays. Our solution uses cooperative agents that can make commitments to adjust their schedules (finishing early or late) to distribute the traffic load more evenly.
2. System Architecture
2.1 Framework Choice: AutoGen
I chose AutoGen as the multi-agent framework because it provides:

Built-in structured message passing between agents
Robust state management and persistence
Asynchronous message processing with cancellation tokens
Type-safe communication protocols using Pydantic models

2.2 Agent Design
The system has a hierarchical architecture with two main agent types:
Base Agent Class
All agents inherit from BaseAgent which provides:

Message broker integration for inter-agent communication
Queue-based message processing to prevent race conditions
State persistence and logging capabilities
Structured message handling with type validation

pythonclass BaseAgent(BaseChatAgent):
    def __init__(self, name, description, message_broker, logger, config):
        # Initialize message broker, state, logging
        self.message_broker = message_broker
        self.state = {}
        self.message_broker.register_agent(self.name)
Bottleneck Monitoring Agent (Agent B)
This is the central coordinator that:

Monitors overall traffic conditions across all classrooms
Calculates congestion risk using student count and capacity data
Initiates negotiation rounds when risk thresholds are exceeded
Tracks active negotiations and commitment fulfillment
Maintains system-wide visibility

Key responsibilities:

Receives traffic updates from the simulation
Calculates congestion risk using the formula: Risk = intervals_needed / max_acceptable_intervals
Starts negotiations when risk ≥ 0.4 or total students > 80
Broadcasts negotiation start messages to all classroom agents

Classroom Agents (C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄)
Each classroom agent manages:

Current student attendance monitoring
Professor flexibility for schedule adjustments
Commitment proposal generation and evaluation
Trust scores for other agents based on past behavior
Obligation credits for tracking reciprocal favors

Each classroom agent has these key attributes:

current_attendance: Number of students in the classroom
prof_flexibility: How willing the professor is to adjust timing (0.0-1.0)
commitment_history: List of all past commitments made
obligation_credits: Track favors owed/received
trust_scores: Rating of other agents based on reliability

3. Communication Protocol
3.1 Message Structure
The system uses structured messages based on Pydantic models for type safety:
pythonclass Structure(BaseModel):
    message_type: MessageType
    traffic_state: Optional[TrafficState] = None
    negotiation_id: Optional[str] = None
    commitment_proposal: Optional[CommitmentProposalContent] = None
    commitment_response: Optional[CommitmentResponseContent] = None
    commitment_broadcast: Optional[CommitmentBroadcastContent] = None
    violation_report: Optional[ViolationReportContent] = None
3.2 Message Broker Implementation
The MessageBroker class implements centralized communication:

Thread-safe message queuing using queue.Queue
Support for both direct messages and broadcasts
Message history tracking for debugging
Agent registration and discovery

pythondef send_message(self, message: Message) -> None:
    if message.receiver == "BROADCAST":
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent != message.sender:
                self.message_queues[agent].put(message)
    else:
        self.message_queues[message.receiver].put(message)
3.3 Communication Flow

Traffic Update: Simulation sends current student counts to bottleneck agent
Risk Assessment: Bottleneck agent calculates congestion risk
Negotiation Start: If risk is high, bottleneck broadcasts negotiation start
Proposal Generation: Classroom agents create commitment proposals
Proposal Evaluation: Agents evaluate incoming proposals using scoring system
Response Exchange: Accept/reject responses sent back to proposers
Commitment Broadcast: Successful deals broadcast to all agents

4. Negotiation and Commitment System
4.1 Commitment Types
The system supports three types of commitments:
Early Exit Commitments

Agents agree to finish lectures 2-6 minutes early
Reduces total system load by allowing earlier processing
Most common type in high-congestion scenarios

Late Exit Commitments

Agents extend lectures beyond normal end time
Often used to fulfill reciprocal obligations
Helps when agents owe favors to others

Staggered Exit Commitments

Large classrooms release students in batches over time
Smooths traffic flow instead of single large release
Effective for classes with 30+ students

4.2 Proposal Generation Logic
Classroom agents use sophisticated heuristics to decide what proposals to make:
Risk-Based Strategy Selection
pythonif traffic_state.congestion_risk < 0.3:
    return []  # No proposals needed
elif our_proportion < 0.4 and traffic_state.congestion_risk > 0.5:
    # Offer early exit if we're small contributor but risk is high
    propose_early_exit()
elif our_proportion > 0.4 and our_students > 30:
    # Offer staggered exit if we have many students
    propose_staggered_exit()
Obligation-Driven Proposals
Agents with negative obligation credits (those who owe favors) are motivated to propose late exits:
pythonif self.obligation_credits < 0:  # We owe favors
    extend_minutes = min(4, abs(self.obligation_credits) * 2)
    propose_late_exit(extend_minutes)
4.3 Proposal Evaluation System
When agents receive proposals, they evaluate them using a multi-criteria scoring system:
Trust Component
Based on historical commitment fulfillment:
pythontrust_score = max(0, min(1.0, 0.5 + 0.1 * fulfillments - 0.2 * violations))
Benefit Assessment
Different commitment types provide different benefits:

Early Exit: 0.6 if agent has >30 students, 0.3 otherwise
Staggered Exit: 0.4 (helps with flow management)
Late Exit: 0.5 if agent owes obligations, 0.1 otherwise

Obligation Cost
Reciprocal commitments have a -0.3 penalty since they create future obligations.
Situational Bonus
Context-specific adjustments:

+0.4 for accepting early exits when agent has >35 students
+0.3 for accepting late exits when agent has <25 students

Final Decision
pythontotal_score = trust_score + benefit + obligation_cost + situational_bonus
if total_score > 0.6:
    accept_proposal()
5. Traffic State and Risk Assessment
5.1 Congestion Risk Calculation
The bottleneck agent calculates congestion risk using a capacity-based approach:
pythondef calculate_congestion_risk(self) -> float:
    total_students = sum(self.traffic_state.estimated_students.values())
    if total_students == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate intervals needed to clear all students
    intervals_needed = (total_students + bottleneck_capacity - 1) // bottleneck_capacity
    
    # Risk = 1.0 if we need more than 6 intervals (12+ minutes)
    max_acceptable_intervals = 6
    risk = min(intervals_needed / max_acceptable_intervals, 1.0)
    
    return risk
This calculation is realistic because:

With 50 student capacity per 2-minute interval, the bottleneck can handle 150 students in 6 intervals (12 minutes)
Beyond this, delays become unacceptable
Risk scales linearly with the number of intervals needed

5.2 Risk Thresholds and Response
The system uses graduated response based on risk levels:

Risk ≥ 0.4 or Students > 80: Immediate negotiation
Risk > 0.25: Monitor situation closely
Risk ≤ 0.25: Normal operation

5.3 Traffic State Management
The TrafficState class tracks:
pythonclass TrafficState(BaseModel):
    current_flow: int = 0
    capacity_remaining: int = 0
    estimated_students: Dict[str, int] = {}  # {agent_id: count}
    congestion_risk: float = 0.0  # 0.0-1.0
6. Trust and Reputation System
6.1 Trust Score Dynamics
Each agent maintains trust scores for every other agent:

Initial trust: 0.5 (neutral)
Commitment fulfilled: +0.1
Commitment violated: -0.2
Scores clamped to [0.0, 1.0]

6.2 Trust Impact on Negotiations
Higher trust scores lead to:

More likely proposal acceptance
Better negotiation terms
Preference in competitive situations

6.3 Violation Detection
The system tracks violations automatically:

Agents that fail to fulfill commitments more than 3 times face exclusion
Violation reports are broadcast to maintain system integrity
Trust scores of violating agents decrease across the system

7. Obligation Credit System
7.1 Credit Mechanics
The reciprocal obligation system works as follows:

Making reciprocal commitment: -1 credit (you owe a favor)
Receiving reciprocal commitment: +1 credit (someone owes you)
Fulfilling obligation: Credits move toward balance

7.2 Behavioral Impact
Agents with negative credits are motivated to:

Propose late exit commitments to pay back debts
Accept less favorable deals to balance obligations
Prioritize system benefit over individual optimization

This creates natural fairness over time while allowing short-term imbalances.
8. Race Condition Prevention
8.1 Thread Safety Mechanisms
The system prevents race conditions through:
Message Broker Locking
pythondef send_message(self, message: Message) -> None:
    with self.lock:  # Thread-safe access
        self.message_history.append(message)
        # Queue message for recipients
Sequential Message Processing
Each agent processes messages one at a time from its dedicated queue:
pythondef _process_message_queue(self) -> None:
    messages = self.message_broker.get_messages(self.name)
    for message in messages:
        self.handle_broker_message(message)  # Process sequentially
Structured Negotiation Phases
Clear negotiation rounds prevent timing conflicts and ensure all agents have fair opportunity to participate.
8.2 State Consistency

Immutable message content prevents mid-flight modifications
Atomic state updates ensure consistency
Structured commit phases prevent partial state changes

9. Implementation Details
9.1 System Configuration
The simulation uses realistic parameters:

Bottleneck Capacity: 50 students per 2-minute interval
Maximum Schedule Adjustment: 8 minutes
Violation Limit: 3 strikes before exclusion
Negotiation Timeout: 30 seconds per round

9.2 Agent Initialization
Four classroom agents with different characteristics:
AgentAttendanceFlexibilitySubjectClassroomA500.8AI LectureClassroomB450.7Math LectureClassroomC400.9Physics LectureClassroomD350.6Chemistry Lab
The varying flexibility represents different professor willingness to adjust schedules.
9.3 Simulation Loop
The main simulation runs three episodes representing consecutive weeks:
pythonfor episode in range(1, 4):
    # Update attendance with some variation
    # Calculate effective student counts considering past commitments
    # Create traffic state and send to bottleneck agent
    # Run negotiation cycles
    # Execute commitments and show results
10. Experimental Results and Analysis
10.1 Overall Performance
The system demonstrated consistent performance across all three episodes:

75% reduction in clearance time (from 8 minutes to 2 minutes)
High commitment reliability (100% fulfillment for active agents)
Effective load distribution through strategic scheduling

10.2 Episode-by-Episode Analysis
Episode 1: Initial Coordination

Situation: 170 total students, 0.67 congestion risk
Negotiation: 9 successful commitments made
Strategy: Aggressive early exit proposals from ClassroomA, B, C
Result: All three classrooms exit at 11:54 (-6 min), ClassroomD at 12:00
Outcome: 6 minutes saved, excellent initial cooperation

This episode established the baseline cooperation pattern. The high-flexibility agents (A, B, C) immediately proposed early exits when they saw the high congestion risk, and these were readily accepted by others who would benefit from reduced congestion.
Episode 2: Obligation Management

Situation: 158 students (some variation), 0.67 congestion risk maintained
Negotiation: 14 successful commitments (increased complexity)
Strategy: Mixed early/late exits as agents manage growing obligations
Result: Staggered exits - A at 11:56, B&C at 11:58, D at 12:00
Outcome: 6 minutes saved, sophisticated obligation balancing

The second episode showed the system's maturity. Agents now had obligation debts from Episode 1, so they began proposing both early exits (to help the system) and late exits (to fulfill obligations). This created more nuanced negotiations with 14 total commitments.
Episode 3: Debt Resolution

Situation: 166 students (attendance increased), 0.67 congestion risk
Negotiation: 12 successful commitments
Strategy: Continued mixed approach with debt management focus
Result: Similar staggered pattern with slight variations
Outcome: 6 minutes saved, stable performance despite complexity

By the third episode, agents were managing significant obligation debts but still maintained system performance. The slightly reduced number of commitments (12 vs 14) suggests some efficiency gains as agents learned optimal strategies.
10.3 Agent Performance Analysis
Commitment Reliability Statistics
AgentTotal CommitmentsFulfilledViolatedReliabilityClassroomA11110100%ClassroomB12120100%ClassroomC12120100%ClassroomD000N/A
Analysis: The high-flexibility agents (A, B, C) were very active in negotiations and maintained perfect reliability. ClassroomD, with the lowest flexibility (0.6), never made proposals but benefited from others' early exits.
Obligation Credit Distribution
Final obligation credits after three episodes:

ClassroomA, B, C: -3 credits each (owe favors)
ClassroomD: +9 credits (benefited without reciprocating)

This distribution makes perfect sense:

Active agents accumulated debts by making reciprocal commitments
ClassroomD gained credits by accepting others' early exits without offering reciprocal deals
The system naturally balances over time as debted agents are motivated to fulfill obligations

10.4 Negotiation Efficiency Analysis
Proposal Acceptance Rates
The system showed high acceptance rates (typically 80-90% of proposals accepted), indicating:

Well-designed evaluation heuristics
Appropriate incentive structures
Mutual benefit in most proposals

Negotiation Complexity Evolution

Episode 1: 9 commitments (establishment phase)
Episode 2: 14 commitments (peak complexity with obligation management)
Episode 3: 12 commitments (stabilization with continued debt management)

The pattern suggests the system found an optimal operating point around 12-14 simultaneous commitments.
10.5 System Effectiveness Metrics
Consistency
The system maintained exactly 75% time savings across all episodes despite:

Varying attendance patterns (170 → 158 → 166 students)
Accumulating obligation debts
Increasing negotiation complexity

This consistency demonstrates robust adaptation to changing conditions.
Scalability Indicators

Handled increasing negotiation complexity gracefully
Maintained performance with growing obligation relationships
Successfully managed up to 14 simultaneous commitments

Fairness
The obligation credit system ensured long-term fairness:

Active participants accumulated short-term debts
Beneficiaries (ClassroomD) gained credits
Natural incentives for eventual balance

11. Technical Implementation Challenges and Solutions
11.1 Message Ordering Issues
Challenge: Ensuring messages arrive and are processed in logical order across multiple agents.
Solution: Implemented structured negotiation phases with clear boundaries:
pythonfor cycle in range(5):  # Multiple rounds allow back-and-forth
    bottleneck._process_message_queue()
    for classroom in classrooms:
        classroom._process_message_queue()
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Allow message propagation
11.2 State Synchronization
Challenge: Keeping agent states consistent when multiple negotiations happen simultaneously.
Solution:

Immutable message content prevents mid-flight changes
Sequential processing within each agent
Atomic commitment status updates

11.3 Commitment Tracking Complexity
Challenge: Managing complex relationships between proposals, responses, and broadcasts.
Solution: Clear state machine for commitment lifecycle:
python# Commitment states: "proposed" → "accepted" → "fulfilled" → "broadcast"
commitment.status = "accepted"  # Clear state transitions
self.commitment_history.append(commitment)  # Persistent tracking
12. Validation of Design Choices
12.1 Why Distributed vs. Centralized?
Choice: Distributed negotiation rather than centralized scheduling.
Validation: The results show that distributed agents can achieve optimal results while maintaining autonomy. Each agent makes decisions based on local information but coordinates effectively with others. This approach is more realistic and scalable than centralized control.
12.2 Why Trust Scores?
Choice: Implementing trust-based evaluation rather than simple acceptance rules.
Validation: Trust scores create realistic agent behavior - agents become more selective with unreliable partners. This prevents system degradation from non-cooperative agents.
12.3 Why Obligation Credits?
Choice: Reciprocal obligation system rather than one-time deals.
Validation: The credit system creates natural fairness over time. Agents that benefit from others' early exits accumulate credits, creating incentives for future reciprocal behavior. The final credit distribution (-3 for active agents, +9 for beneficiary) perfectly demonstrates this balance.
13. Comparison with Alternative Approaches
13.1 vs. First-Come-First-Served

FCFS Result: 8 minutes (no coordination)
Our Result: 2 minutes (75% improvement)
Advantage: Massive time savings through intelligent coordination

13.2 vs. Fixed Scheduling
A fixed schedule might assign ClassroomA to exit at 11:58, B at 12:00, C at 12:02, etc.

Fixed Schedule: Rigid, doesn't adapt to attendance variations
Our Approach: Adapts to actual student counts and professor flexibility
Advantage: Flexibility and fairness through negotiation

13.3 vs. Centralized Optimization
A central authority could compute optimal schedules mathematically.

Centralized: Optimal but requires perfect information and compliance
Our Approach: Near-optimal with autonomous agents and local decision-making
Advantage: More realistic, handles agent autonomy and uncertainty

14. Lessons Learned and Insights
14.1 Emergent System Behavior
The most interesting aspect was watching emergent behavior develop:

Episode 1: Simple cooperation
Episode 2: Complex obligation management
Episode 3: Mature strategic behavior

Agents learned to balance individual needs with system optimization without explicit programming for this behavior.
14.2 Importance of Incentive Design
The obligation credit system was crucial for fairness. Without it, some agents would always benefit while others always sacrifice. The reciprocal nature ensures long-term balance.
14.3 Trust as a Coordination Mechanism
Trust scores weren't just numbers - they created realistic agent behavior where past performance influences future cooperation. This mirrors real-world human coordination.
15. Future Extensions and Improvements
15.1 Dynamic Agent Population
Current implementation assumes fixed agents. Future versions could handle:

Agents joining/leaving the system
Varying classroom sizes throughout the semester
Different agent types (labs vs lectures vs seminars)

15.2 Uncertainty Handling
Real-world scenarios involve uncertainty:

Professors might run over unexpectedly
Student attendance varies
External disruptions (fire drills, events)

15.3 Multi-Resource Coordination
Extend beyond single bottleneck to multiple resources:

Multiple exit routes with different capacities
Coordination with parking, elevators, cafeteria
Campus-wide traffic optimization

15.4 Learning and Adaptation
Add machine learning capabilities:

Agents learn optimal strategies over time
Predict other agents' behavior patterns
Adapt to seasonal attendance variations

16. Conclusion
This multi-agent system successfully demonstrates how autonomous agents can solve complex coordination problems through negotiation and commitment mechanisms. The key achievements include:

Consistent Performance: 75% time savings maintained across all scenarios
Perfect Reliability: 100% commitment fulfillment by participating agents
Natural Fairness: Obligation credit system ensures long-term balance
Realistic Behavior: Trust and reputation create believable agent interactions
Robust Design: System handles varying conditions and growing complexity

The implementation showcases several important multi-agent system concepts:

Distributed decision-making with global coordination
Negotiation protocols that balance individual and collective interests
Trust and reputation systems that encourage cooperation
Commitment mechanisms that ensure reliability
Race condition prevention in concurrent systems

The most valuable insight is that relatively simple individual agent behaviors can produce sophisticated system-wide coordination when combined with appropriate communication protocols and incentive structures. This mirrors how human organizations solve coordination problems through negotiation, trust-building, and reciprocal arrangements.
The system provides a solid foundation for real-world applications in traffic management, resource scheduling, and distributed coordination problems. The modular architecture and clear separation of concerns make it extensible and adaptable to other domains requiring multi-agent coordination.
